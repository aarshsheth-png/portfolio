## ❓ Still Confused?

**Think of it like this:**
- **Terminal** = The engine that runs your website
- **Browser** = The window where you see your website
- **Hygraph** = The storage where your content lives (on the internet)

You need all three:
1. Terminal running `npm run dev` ✅
2. Browser open at http://localhost:3000 ✅
3. Content in Hygraph (you add this) ✅

2. Make sure you're in the right folder
3. Try `npm install` first if you get module errors
4. Check that port 3000 isn't already in use
